# Quality insurance

This document covers the actions taken to ensure that quality is maintained in the project.

## Merging rules

The `main` branch is **protected** and **requires** a Pull Request from either a `milestone/*` or `hotfix/*` branch to be updated. Likewise `milestone/*` branches are also protected and **requires** a Pull request  to be updated.

### Branch naming convention

- Hotfixes branches should be named `hotfix/*` with `*` being replaced by a short description of the hotfix consisting of 6 words or less. They describe a quick fix on an important bug that is already present in the main branch.
- Milestones branches should be named `milestone/*` with `*` being replaced by a short description of the milestone consisting of 3 words or less. They describe a group of thematically linked features/fixes/refactors.
- Others branches besides main and those two pattern should be attached to a milestone. As such, their naming pattern is as follows: `<branch type>/<milestone-name>/*`.
    - `branch-type` indicates whether the branch corresponds to a new feature (`feature/*`), a bug fix (`fix/*`) a refactor (`refactor/*`) or something else.
    - `milestone-name` correspond to the milestone the branch is attached to.
    - `*` should be a short description of the branch consisting of 6 words or less.

**Note**: an exception can be made in the case of documentation that **doesn't** involve modifying the code base **and** isn't linked to particular milestone, those branches should be named `docs/global/*`with `*` being replaced by a short description of the hotfix consisting of 4 words or less.

**Naming exemples**:
If we create a milestone named *web-server*.
- Milestone branch:
  - `milestone/web-server`

- Feature branches for this milestone:
  - `feature/web-server/add-request-logging`
  - `feature/web-server/support-https`

- Bug fix branches for this milestone:
  - `fix/web-server/fix-500-error-on-timeout`

- Refactor branches for this milestone:
  - `refactor/web-server/improve-routing-logic`

- Chore branches for this milestone:
  - `chore/web-server/update-readme`

- Hotfix branches (can bypass milestones and go directly into `main`):
  - `hotfix/rollback-broken-migration`

### Status checks

In order to merge a branch to main or a milestone, status checks must pass. Those are:
- **Allowed to merge**: only milestone, hotfixes and global documentation branches should be able to merge into main. This pass by default if the target branch is a milestone.
- **Lint check**: Python code should be PEP8 compliant. This is ignored if the branch to be merged is a milestone as milestone code should already be PEP8 compliant.
- **Static type check**: Python code should be MyPy compliant. This is ignored if the branch to be merged is a milestone as milestone code should already be well typed.
- **Unit and integration wide tests**: ran everywhere
- **Project wide tests**: those concerns E2E, Golden Master and tests that compare/test the whole program. As those are heavy, they are ran only on milestones and hotfixes branches.
- **Coverage threshold**: A miminum of 80% of coverage should be attained through tests to pass, ran everywhere

```
main (protected)

  â”œâ”€â”€ hotfix/* (all status checks required)
  â””â”€â”€ milestone/*: (protected, status checks required*)
        ðŸ¡‘
        â”œâ”€â”€ feature/<milestone-name>/*      â”‚
        â”œâ”€â”€ refactor/<milestone-name>/*     â”œâ”€â”€ (status checks required*)
        â”œâ”€â”€ fix/<milestone-name>/*          â”‚

## Testing policy

### Unit testing

Each fonction should be tested as much as needed to explore as much logic branchs. Test should then involve both valid cases and edges cases.
