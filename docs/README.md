## Contributing to Documentation

When updating documentation:

1. **Always update GWC_IMPLEMENTATION.md first** - it's the single source of truth
2. **Add changelog entries** at the bottom of GWC_IMPLEMENTATION.md
3. **Keep examples up to date** with actual working code
4. **Test code snippets** before adding them to docs
5. **Update this index** when adding new doc files

### Documentation Style Guide

- Use clear, concise language
- Include working code examples
- Provide both CLI and API examples where applicable
- Link between related sections
- Keep table of contents updated
